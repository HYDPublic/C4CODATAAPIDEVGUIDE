## SAP Cloud for Customer OData API Developer's Guide
The SAP Cloud for Customer OData API Developer’s Guide complements the [SAP Cloud for Customer OData API Reference](add link) with usage details and samples for SAP Cloud for Customer OData API in a format that is most convenient to developers. Furthermore, it also covers known restrictions and limitations of the SAP Cloud for Customer OData API.

For a brief introduction to SAP Cloud for Customer OData API, please refer to [SAP Cloud for Customer OData API Getting Started Guide](add link).

### What is OData protocol?
[Open Data (OData) Protocol](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=odata) is an OASIS standard that defines best practices for building and consuming RESTful APIs. It is based on HTTP protocol and provides metadata for the entities it exposes and their relationships. In some ways, it is similar to SQL for a relational database system (RDBMS) as it provides querying options such as filtering, ordering results, support for pagination, number of records and more. It supports both XML (Atom) and JSON formats for querying and modifying data.

For more information on OData please refer to http://www.odata.org where you can find detailed documentation and tutorials. 

### OData versions
SAP Cloud for Customer, specifically, supports the V2.0 of the OData protocol (with some additional enhancements and a few limitations), you can read the details of OData V2 [here](http://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-2-0/).

### SAP Cloud for Customer (C4C) OData Services
You can try the examples shown in this document by accessing the OData API of your C4C tenant using the following URL pattern:
https://myNNNNNN.crm.ondemand.com/sap/c4c/odata/v1/odataservicecatalog/ODataServiceCollection where myNNNNNN is the name of your tenant.

Here is an example URL for a test tenant:
`https://odatac4ctrial.hana.ondemand.com/proxy/sap/c4c/odata/v1/c4codata/`

### Service Metadata
OData service metadata is retrieved by opening the following URL.

https://<c4c_tenant>/sap/c4c/odata/v1/c4codata/$metadata - where you need to replace <c4c_tenant> with the domain of your C4C tenant (e.g. my123456.crm.ondemand.com).

### OData Service Document
OData service document contains the list of OData entities (a.k.a. collections) contained within that OData service. In order to retrieve the complete list of entities included in C4C OData service, you can open the following URL in your browser.

https://<c4c_tenant>/sap/c4c/odata/v1/c4codata/ (Please note at the time of writing this blog, ‘/’ at the end of the URI is required!)

To get the same information in JSON format, you need to add $format=json into your query. (i.e. https://<c4c_tenant>/sap/c4c/odata/v1/c4codata/?format=json )


Querying Data
In order to retrieve complete list of accounts (i.e. customer records), one can simply type the following URL in a web browser where <c4c_tenant> should be replaced with your actual c4c tenant:
https://<c4c_tenant>/sap/c4c/odata/v1/c4codata/AccountCollection

Once the required username and password is provided, a result page similar to the following is seen:


Query Options
OData protocol defines a number of query options that can be used for retrieving data. Here, I will provide examples of some of the commonly used query options:

Filtering results – $filter
https://<c4c_tenant>/sap/c4c/odata/v1/c4codata/AccountCollection?$filter=AccountName eq 'Hamiltons'



Retrieving limited number of records – $top
https://<c4c_tenant>/sap/c4c/odata/v1/c4codata/AccountCollection?$top=5

(Following is the response with actual entries collapsed for brevity)


Applying several query options at once
OData query options can be concatenated with & similar to a regular HTTP GET query. 

Following example retrieves “the IDs and Names of last 5 Accounts created, as a JSON document”.
https://<c4c_tenant>/sap/c4c/odata/v1/c4codata/AccountCollection?$select=AccountID,AccountName&$top=5&$orderby=CreatedOn desc&$format=json



For a complete list of OData Version 2.0 URI conventions you can refer to http://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-2-0/uri-conventions/.


Reading a single Account record
In order to read a single record, an OData service should be called with the associated key field(s) value in the query URL. 

https://<c4c_tenant>/sap/c4c/odata/v1/c4codata/AccountCollection('00163E038C2E1EE299C1BB0BE9398F9B')


To receive the same result in JSON format:
https://<c4c_tenant>/sap/c4c/odata/v1/c4codata/AccountCollection('00163E038C2E1EE299C1BB0BE9398F9B')?$format=json







Reading an Associated Entity
In order to read one of the associated entities (e.g. AccountMainAddress);

https://<c4c_tenant>/sap/c4c/odata/v1/c4codata/AccountCollection('00163E038C2E1EE299C1BB0BE9398F9B')/AccountMainAddress






















Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention in SAP Cloud for Customer
“Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack that occurs when a malicious web site, email, blog, instant message, or program causes a user’s web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site for which the user is currently authenticated.” 
(See more details here)

In order to prevent CSRF attacks, in C4C any modifying OData operation is required to provide a valid X-CSRF-Token as part of the HTTP request header. Required X-CSRF-Token can be requested from the C4C system for the same user, prior to the modifying OData operation. The following section describes the process of requesting and providing an X-CSRF-Token.

Requesting an X-CSRF-Token
In order to request an X-CSRF-Token, any query operation to an OData entity should have the following HTTP header and its value.

HTTP Header
Value
X-CSRF-Token
Fetch

Sample request call:

Parameter

URL
https://<c4c_tenant>/sap/c4c/odata/v1/c4codata/AccountCollection

HTTP Header
x-csrf-token:fetch
