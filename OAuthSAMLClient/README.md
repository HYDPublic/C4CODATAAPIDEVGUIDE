## OAuthSAMLClient

Sample app that demonstrates the flow to get an OAuth Bearer token based on a SAML2.0 assertion for an SAP Cloud for Customer tenant. The token obtained can be used for SSO while invoking OData services offered by SAP Cloud for customer tenant.

### Pre-requisites:
In your SAP Cloud for Customer tenant please register an:

* OAuth IDP (Identity provider)
* OAuth Client

The above mentioned activities can be performed in the Administration work-center in your SAP Cloud for Customer tenant. 

In order for the sample to run the following things need to be done:

* Add a JKS key-store to the project (e.g. in the current example the key-store is called as venkyvb.jks).
* Adjust the settings in the **settings.properties** file as follows:
  * CLIENT_ID = valid client ID based on the OAuth client registration mentioned above
  * CLIENT_SECRET = valid client secret associated with the OAuth client registration
  * ISSUER = your app which is registered as an OAuth IDP in your SAP Cloud for Customer tenant
  * NAME_ID = named user in SAP Cloud for customer tenant for whom the OAuth token is being requested (note that in real scenarios this would be determined based on the current logged in user in your app)
  * ENTITY_ID = Tenant URL without the protocol (HTTPS://)
  * TOKEN_SERVICE_URL = https://your_tenant_url/sap/bc/sec/oauth2/token
  * KEY_STORE_PASS = JKS keystore password
  * ...

The token obtained in this step needs to be added as a part of the "Authorization" header for the OData calls. The header should looke like:

* Header name = "Authorization"
* Value = "Bearer " + access_token


Note that this is just an illustrative sample.

Happy coding !!


### Certificate creation via OpenSSL
Here is the steps to create a self-signing certificate for registering your OAuth client. (You may need to download OpenSSL first)
 

1) Generate a key

```
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out server.key 2048
```

2) Generate cert request for CA

```
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -new -key server.key -out server.csr
```

3) Self sign the certificate

```
openssl x509 -sha256 -days 3652 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out selfsigned.cer
```

4) Create pkcs12 key store

```
openssl pkcs12 -export -name myservercert -in selfsigned.cer -inkey server.key -out keystore.p12
```

5) Convert pkcs12 into JKS keystore

```
keytool -importkeystore -destkeystore mykeystore.jks -srckeystore keystore.p12 -srcstoretype pkcs12 -alias myservercert
```

6) Verify

```
keytool -list -v -keystore mykeystore.jks
```
